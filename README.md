# Permissive Action Link (PAL - Prj. Electron)
Oh boy. We're going to be put on a list for this one. 

Permissive Action Link (PAL) systems are the hardware and software safeguards that protect nuclear weapons from accidental or unauthorized detonation. Though their implementation has change radically over the years the electronics industry has evolved, their premise is simple. Permissive Action Links use strong cryptographic functions to "Lock" and "Unlock" the flow of electricty to dangerous loads. This project is a simplified recreation of one of these systems that uses easily aquireable programmable microcontrollers and off-the-shelf components.
