# Permissive Action Link (PAL - Prj. Spectra)
Oh boy. We're going to be put on a list for this one. 

## LEGAL
This project is one implemenation based on a surface level understanding of the Permissive Action Link technology, obtained from publicly available and distributed content. It is **not** intended to be used to understand how actual realworld systems work. It **is** indended to be a tool to demonstrate how readily available tools can be used to create strong cryptographic electro-mechanical interlocks.

## Background
Permissive Action Link (PAL) systems are the hardware and software safeguards that protect nuclear weapons from accidental or unauthorized detonation. Though their implementation has change radically over the years the electronics industry has evolved, their premise is simple. Permissive Action Links use strong cryptographic functions to "Lock" and "Unlock" the flow of electricty to dangerous loads. This project is a simplified recreation of one of these systems that uses easily aquireable programmable microcontrollers and off-the-shelf components.
